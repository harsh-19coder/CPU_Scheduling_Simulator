• Built a simulator demonstrating scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin.
• Implemented scheduling logic in C++ for accurate computation of waiting and turnaround times.
• Created a Python Tkinter-based graphical interface to visualize process execution using Gantt charts.
• Improved learning by providing interactive comparison of algorithms with calculated performance metrics.
